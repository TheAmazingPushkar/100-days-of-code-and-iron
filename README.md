## Daily Log
dec:2|day 1| learned a bit of django| **One day or day one. You decide**

dec:3|day 2| kinda started with tinker, borrowed two cool python books, im still elevating and ill grow |


dec:4|day 3| Today was fun college was good, a pretty decent day and this logging thing im doing im finding it fun, today i did a bit python regular expressions
, gave a nice speech for class assignment which i aced, I found hackathon like global where i can register and participate and my heart is pumping.
I borrowed two books from library and started reading one its called python for data analysis and i completed first two chaps it was fun, I googled about data science and its really cool.I also made a daily schedule 
for my college days ,overall a decent day and mainly all 4 protocols were completed


dec:5|day 4| did a bit of oops and file handling, this month my schedule and targets are hectic


dec:6|day 5|I did not do anything, i felt really bad about myself cause i don't fit in at all, did all lot of self reflection asked llm's if something in my character is wrong, i got no real help.
Thus i decided ill just keep a goal and work towards it and i eventually might meet people who have similar mindset to me.
so thus today on dec-6|2025 i have set a really big goal that'll change my life completely in ways ill be proud 10 years later.


dec:8|day 7|I missed to upload yesterday cause of lack of data in my pack but well day 6 and 7 complete. Honestly college life has become too stressful, tooo much work and i also have 
global hack week from 12th, then nptel jan 19th i guess it'll all come down to time management..good luck pushkar....

dec:11| day 8|I feel i have hit many walls yesterday we had our coding club meet of adroit . my seniors told me alot of things and then i came to my senses i've wasted nearly my first sem. I did
do on my own but it was not enough at all. I even did fail misserably at  making friends people either hate me or envy or don't bother about me at all. There are kind of groups in my first sem class and i am a 
oddball not in any. Honestly i'll just elevate myself as these groups and me included cannot compare to my best friend in bits the amount of knowledge .I have time, everybody does so i'll just use it and grow, 
i guess.
